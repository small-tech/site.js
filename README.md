# ⚠️ This repository has moved away from GitHub

## 👉️ [Site.js git repository (source code)](https://codeberg.org/site.js/app)

Its new home is on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), an independent and ethical not-for-profit git hosting service that’s powered by donations, doesn’t track you, and is hosted in the EU. 

(They also don’t [violate your licenses to train their shitty AIs](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral/106500204227978913).)
